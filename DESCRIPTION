Description: The missRows package implements the MI-MFA method to deal with missing 
    individuals ('biological units') in multi-omics data integration. The MI-MFA method 
    generates multiple imputed datasets from a Multiple Factor Analysis model, then the 
    yield results are combined in a single consensus solution. The package provides 
    functions for estimating coordinates of individuals and variables, imputing missing 
    individuals, and various diagnostic plots to inspect the pattern of missingness and 
    visualize the uncertainty due to missing values.
